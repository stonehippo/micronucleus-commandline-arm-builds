# micronucleus-commandline-arm-builds

Build of the Micronucleus command line tool for ARMv6/ARMv7.

This is an ARM build of version 2.04 of the [Micronucleus command line tool](https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus/tree/master/commandline). I built it to help out with getting a modern set of binaries for use with [ATTinyCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore/issues/465). Otherwise not sure what it's good for.
